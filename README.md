# üéâ Build your own Custom GPT Resume Chat

### üõà Purpose 
During interviews I often found myself forgetting important points, or not articulating my answers well during because I just don‚Äôt have a response to every possible question that could be asked, committed to memory.
So I created a Custom GPT to allow recruiters and hiring managers to gain deeper insights into my personality, qualifications, knowledge, and experience in a fun and interactive way. 

### ü§∑üèΩ How it works
* Share your custom GPT App link with recruiters, and hiring managers.
* They must have a GPT Plus subscription ‚Äì OpenAI.com ‚Äì https://www.openai.com/
* They ask interview questions to dive into your professional journey, and get to know you.
* Your app's responses are limited to your resume, and other data that you provide.

‚ö†Ô∏è These directions assume that you already have a GPT Plus account, and are familiar with building GPT Apps.<br>
‚ö†Ô∏è The docs provided are examples. You will need to edit them, or create your own. <br>
‚ö†Ô∏è You're not limited to what I've done here. I'm merely showing my work to help kick start some ideas.

# üë∑ How to build it!


## 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Prompt: 
The first step is to give your custom GPT direction, and purpose.  You can obviously fine tune it how you wish, but you need to define the parameters by which is should operate, 
and the data is should draw from. I've provided a sample prompt sheet to use as a starting point. 

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the Data: 
This app is to represent you as if you are being interviews, so you will need to give it the data from which to draw answers. I've configured my version of the app to draw from 4 main files (docx or PDF) 
1. Resume.pdf: As a resume' based app, starting with a solid resume' is important. Since I'm applying for 2 different roles, I've suppliedmine with 2 different resume's customized for those roles, and formatted for application tracking systems. If neeed help with resume formats, I have <a href="https://github.com/BoredApps/Free-Resume-Templates">free resume templates here</a>. 
2. Skills.pdf:  I created a doc that just lists skills, categorized as "Familiar with" (Understand or learning), "Proficient with" (Hands on in a production enviroment), and "Experienced with" (Significant experience), "Expert". You can categorize them
   how you want, or chose not to do this step. 
4. Questions.pdf: I simply asked Chat GPT for examples of common interview questions for the positions I am applying, and supplimented with info from job descriptions I'd applied to, previous interviews,
   and created a doc of answers to those questions.
5. LinkedIn.pdf: You will need to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a541960/save-a-profile-as-a-pdf?lang=en-us&intendedLocale=en" target="_blank">export your LinkedIn profile as a pdf</a>, and upload to your custom GPT 
6. I also uploded the Directions.pdf with the original prompt for it to remind itself of it's role, and where it will draw the data.
7. <b>Make sure to edit your prompts and directions to make it draw from whatever files you've upload, and why it should do that. </b>

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Test, fine tune, and share. 
You will find many things that you want to apply to your custom resume chat. Test, fine tune, and share your app's link with the world.
